> This is a React application for playing the Tenzies game. The game involves rolling dice and trying to achieve &#34;tenzies&#34; where all dice have the same value and are held.
### Game Rules
- When the game starts, you will see a welcome screen. Click on the "Start Game" button to begin.
- The game consists of six dice initially.
- Click on the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.
- Each time you roll the dice, new values will be generated for the dice that are not held.
- You can choose to hold or release dice by clicking on them.
- The goal of the game is to achieve "tenzies" by holding all dice with the same value.
- If you achieve tenzies, the game will reset, and your duration and roll count will be recorded.
- The best time achieved will be stored and displayed.
- You can play the game again by clicking on the "Roll Dice" button.
